The `client/src/app/states` Directory
===============

The various states / routes in the application are mapped to folders in this directory. [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
is used for state management / routing. Have a look at the README in any of the subfolders (e.g, [client/src/app/states/home/README.md](https://github.com/ifyio/angularjs-lazy-loading-with-requirejs-optimisation/tree/master/client/src/app/states/home)) for an in-depth explanation of the
conventions.
